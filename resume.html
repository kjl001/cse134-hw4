				<li>In my high school years, I volunteered at a place to tutor elementary and middle school students on math. There, I have
				experienced having to teach younger kids and make sure to keep everything organized. I have also had to try and manage
				the logistics behind the tutoring section, such as the finances and scheduling. </li>
				<li>During high school, I also joined a Computer Science club and helped fellow students learn about the basics
				of Computer Science. This in turn has also helped me be more familiarized with Computer Science and also with methods
				of being able to learn certain materials efficiently.</li>
